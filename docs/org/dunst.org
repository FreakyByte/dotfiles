[[https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst][Dunst]] is my notification daemon. This means it is responsible for actually displaying the notifications that other apps want to send. You can send your own notifications using =notify-send=.

The configuration below is mostly for visuals. You can find all configuration options [[https://dunst-project.org/documentation/][here]].
