[[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][Rofi]] is my application launcher, replacing the classic dmenu. When rofi is run, a menu opens where I can type whatever program I want to use.

If I remember correctly, this config is mostly taken form [[https://github.com/elenapan/dotfiles/blob/master/config/rofi/config.rasi][elenapan]]. There's a couple details I'd probably change if I get around to it, but it just works, so more than good enough.

The last line loads the current colorscheme generated by [[https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal][pywal]].
