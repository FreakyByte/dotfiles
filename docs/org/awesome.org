The [[https://awesomewm.org/][awesome]] window manager lives up to its name. It is an awesome window manager, and I really enjoyed using it for like 2 to 3 years!

* The Glorious Dotfiles
My awesome config is basically the [[https://github.com/eromatiya/the-glorious-dotfiles/tree/master/config/awesome/floppy][floppy theme]] from [[https://github.com/eromatiya/the-glorious-dotfiles][the glorious dotfiles]]. Quite an elaborate setup, closer to an actual desktop environment than a window manager. They are unfortunately deprecated since 2020 (so already have been when I started using it - I guess I was hoping ^^).

I'm not gonna do a complete documentation on them here, that'd be /a lot/ of work. Instead, check out the original [[https://github.com/eromatiya/the-glorious-dotfiles/wiki][wiki]].

** My Changes
Among others, my changes include:
 - fixed an issue resulting from a newer Lua version, see [[https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/issues/3563#issuecomment-1036000769][here]]
 - made left sidebar hideable (and hidden by default), moving the tag-list to the top bar
 - using [[https://github.com/frioux/charitable][Charitable]] to imitate the way multiple monitors are handled in [[https://xmonad.org/][xmonad]]
 - changing a couple icons to the Flat-Remix icon theme
 - changing the rofi appmenu to the one from https://github.com/elenapan/dotfiles
 - using pywal for wallpapers and colorscheme
 - added variable to ~config.lua~ to make different settings for my two machines possible
 - just general customization of tags and stuff

** Two different Setups
In order to have different configs on my desktop ("One") and laptop ("IdeaPad") like showing/hiding the battery status etc., there is a variable in the file =awesome/configuration/config.lua= that needs to be set. To have this variable change (and other private options) not synced to my Github, this file is put in =.gitignore=, and a template file =awesome/configuration/config.lua.template= is provided instead. So what you gotta do is:
#+begin_src bash
mv awesome/configuration/config.lua.template awesome/configuration/config.lua
#+end_src
Then configure the variable =system= in =awesome/configuration/config.lua= to the one you want:
- If you want the desktop config: set ~system = One~ (default)
- If you want the laptop config: set ~system = Ideapad~
Also configure the other variables in that file, like username, email, OpenWeather API key, etc.

** Planned Changes
I also had a bunch of other changes planned that I never had the time to implement:
- more configuration of the side bar menu, to do things like moving windows between tags etc. from a touchscreen
- make window titlebars toggleable - I kinda started doing it, but right now if you disable them and open a new window, it's gonna have them enabled again and it's a whole mess
- configure Desktop right-click menu, possibly as an app launcher for touchscreen
- add list of running programs to statusbar (e.g. for unminimizing windows through the GUI)

* Reasons why I switched
Even though I really liked awesome, I switched to qtile in 2024. Here's a short summary why:
- I wanted to change a bunch of things, and doing so in this big elaborate config that I didn't properly document and didn't really fully remember the structure of seemed daunting. So I wanted to start over with a config of my own.
- I know a little bit of Python, but the tiny bit of Lua I know I learned from configuring this in 2021 or something. So switching to a window manager where I can use python seemed simpler.
- Qtile also just seemed simpler in general, making a more clear and minimal config possible (though maybe I am biased by using a big awesome config I didn't fully understand).
- I discovered the widget system [[https://github.com/elkowar/eww][eww]], which I wanted to switch to, especially for touch screen stuff (still a big work in progress ^^). So I didn't need the broad widgeting capabilities of awesome anymore.
- Awesome has no plans to be ported to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)][Wayland]], whereas qtile already has a Wayland version. (This is a very minor reason for me though. At the time of writing this, I'm using qtile on X11.)
