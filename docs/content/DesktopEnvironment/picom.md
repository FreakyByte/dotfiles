My [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) config. Picom is the compositor, meaning that it takes care of transparency and blur of window background, as well as other visual niceties.

You can find all available configuration options [here](https://man.archlinux.org/man/picom.1.en).

```python
{{% include file="symlink/picom.conf" %}}
```
