* About this Config
This is the configuration of my linux machines. It's not particularly polished, but maybe you'll find some bits and pieces you like.
Or maybe you actually just want to steal all of it. In that case, sure, go for it.

I use this on two machines: a desktop PC (called "One") and a Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5 (called "IdeaPad"). Both are running Linux Mint.
Some things I want to be configured differently on those two devices. For awesome this is done with a variable in the config. For other parts, seperate configs have been put in ~./One/~ and ~./IdeaPad/~.

In case you don't know whether this config is for you, here's a short bit that might help you find out. Past that, I guess you're just gonna have to try it.
** What this Config tries to do
 - be both efficient for work (using almost exclusively the keyboard) and chill to use for entertainment (operated with a mouse like a more common desktop environment)
 - be clean and visually appealing while remaining functionality
 - be taylored to my specific need
** What this Config doesn't try to do
- banish the mouse completely
- be minimalist/suckless
- be completely bugfree and professionally maintained
- be user friendly to everyone

* Installation
** Dependencies
The dependencies are listed for [[#parts-of-the-config][each part of the config]] seperately, since they're relatively independent.

*Important for users of Debian-based distros.* A lot of parts of this config needs software updates that are not available yet in e.g. Ubuntu repositories. So things might not work if you just install the dependencies through apt. To get a newer version of a software than available in your repos, you can use a PPA if available, or manually build and install the software from github.

Trust me, this awkward situation of not being able to install everything through the same means, namely the package manager you know and love, annoys me greatly, too. It's making me think about switching to Arch or Manjaro. But other than this there's no point for me to change distros currently, so I'll stick with my Mint for now.

If version numbers are specified in the tables below, they are the versions installed on my machine at the time of writing this. I don't have the time to research whether older versions are suffiecient as well, but it should helpful for your troubleshooting.

** install.sh

* Parts of the Config
** "Desktop Environment": awesomewm + more
This is mostly taken from the amazing config over at [[https://github.com/manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles][The Glorious Dotfiles]], specifically the "Floppy" version.
My changes to it include:
 - made left sidebar hideable (and hidden by default), moving the tag-list to the top bar
 - using [[https://github.com/frioux/charitable][Charitable]] to replicate the way multiple monitors are handled in [[https://xmonad.org/][xmonad]]
 - changing a couple icons to the Flat-Remix icon theme
 - changing the rofi appmenu to the one from https://github.com/elenapan/dotfiles
 - using pywal for wallpapers and colorscheme
 - added variable to ~config.lua~ to make different settings for my two machines possible
 - just general customization of tags and stuff

** DOOM Emacs
If you don't know this already, keep in mind: *Emacs is not a text editor.*
Precisely, Emacs is an elisp interpreter, but that probably doesn't help much. The important part is that Emacs is an entire ecosystem of tools. Text editing is only one thing it can do (even though quite awkwardly in my opinion, if you don't use evil mode). Other killer features are for example org mode (which I use for managing my TODOs, creating READMEs like this and literate configs, and even organizing D&D sessions) and magit (a git interface). It's also entirely self-documenting, which is pretty epic. Basically everything you can program in elisp, you can have as a tool in Emacs.

I use [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][DOOM Emacs]] since it provides sensible defaults (I don't have time for building an Emacs config from scratch), a great package management system and a helpful community. I switched from using vim as a text editor to doing it within Emacs, so naturally I'm using evil mode keybindings.

If you're new to Emacs or if you don't know whether it's for you yet, the following links might be helpful:
 - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4&t=267s][A video to sell you on org mode.]]
 - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_iX5US1_xE][A demonstration of magit.]]
 - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCMh7srOqvw][Tutorials specifically for Doom.]]
 - [[https://discord.gg/qvGgnVx][Link to Doom Emacs' Discord community.]]

*** Dependencies
[[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs#install][Just install Doom Emacs.]] You might need to install a newer version of Emacs than available in your repositories.

** Vim
Vim used to be my main text editor. Nowadays I mostly use Emacs, but Vim is still nice to quickly edit some files straight from the terminal.

Because of this, I intend on shrinking my Vim config quite a bit. This paragraph will be expanded once this is done.
** i3
Before awesome, I used i3 as my window manager. Now I only use it if I severely screwed up my awesome config, but it's still nice to have.

I have two different versions of this config, one for my desktop PC (found in ~./One/~), and one for my Laptop (found in ~./IdeaPad/~)

*** Dependencies
This config uses [[https://github.com/resloved/i3][Rounded i3-gaps]], a fork of a fork of i3wm that supports gaps and rounded corners. It seems gaps are nowadays part or regular i3 (I have not tested this), but rounded corners still aren't.
Installation instructions can be found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/benebi/i3gaps_i3_rounded_corners/eqrmews/][here]]. To build it, [[https://github.com/Airblader/i3/wiki/Building-from-source#dependencies][these additional dependencies]] must be met.

Required dependencies:

Optional dependencies:

|-------------+----------------------+------------------------|
| Ubuntu font | a font I really like | font in i3 and polybar |

** Terminal: fish and kitty
** Scripts
** Special Touchscreen Stuff for the IdeaPad

* A Look into the Future
** Known Issues
- Awesome: sometimes at startup, picom is not started correctly and thus transparency and blur don't work
  I do not know what the cause of this is, but it happens way less now that I have installed a SSD into my system. So it's probably timing related.
  Current workaround is to open the left sidebar, ever-so-slightly change the blur in settings, and restart awesome
** Planned Features
- xfce4/awesome: create config that uses these at the same time
- Awesome: Configure Sidebars more
- Awesome: make window titlebars toggleable
- Awesome: make moving windows to different workspaces possible through GUI
- Awesome: configure Desktop right-click menu
- Awesome: create icons for tiling layouts
- Awesome: add list of running programs to statusbar (i.e. for unminimizing windows throug GUI)
- Emacs: improve LaTeX config
- Emacs: Setup as a Python IDE
- Vim: cleanup vimrc
- i3: cleanup i3config
- Scripts: make screen rotation scripts compatiple with awesome
- Scripts: create installer script
- improve this readme and add screenshots
